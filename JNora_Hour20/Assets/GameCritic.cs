 * 1. I think the game is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. I found that recovering after hitting
 * an obstacle is actually really easy. When time slows down, it gives you better precision and a bit of
 * time to think (but I guess that's probably just the intended effect). I also feel like the difficulty
 * so variable that it can be really REALLY easy or hard at times - it just depends whether or not you
 * get lucky with the placements.
 * 
 * 2. For starters, I would change the phase out mechanic to be a little shorter, because it seems almost
 * pointless if there are no situations where it's absolutely necessary. Additionally, I would introduce
 * new layouts of obstacles, like a laser wall that shows up once in a while that you need to use the
 * phasing ability to avoid, otherwise you lose a couple seconds.
 * 
 * 3. I think the game needs an actual soundtrack and some sound effects too. Right now the game is fine,
 * but without that extra ambiance it seems a little dull.
 * 
 * 4. I think the randomness of the collidables keeps it more fun as opposed to spawning in the same spots
 * (there wouldn't even be a challenge then!) But I also am pretty fond of the phasing ability, I just
 * wish it were better utilized or improved.
 * 
 * 5. Without much variety aside from the two existing prefabs, the game goes stale pretty quick. If there
 * were more levels or even sets of obstacle/powerup spawn layouts, I think that would make the game more
 * engaging.
 * 
 * Obstacle Prefab Changes - I stretched out the mesh and rotated it to make it look like a lazer grid,
 * with the wall material which is far more menacing than a little red brick on the ground.
 * 
 * Powerup Prefab Changes - I made the particles look more like a trail instead of a glowing effect.
